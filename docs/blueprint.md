## Core Features:

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to represent intelligence, clarity, and trust. Its vibrancy will make elements such as the 'Get Started' CTA pop on the user interface.
- Background color: A very light blue (#E0F7FA) to give a sense of calm and spaciousness without distracting from the video content.
- Accent color: A bright cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight interactive elements and important information. It will only appear on optional UI elements, ensuring the user isn't overwhelmed by it.
- Use clean, sans-serif fonts to maintain a modern, readable design, such as Roboto, or Open Sans.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for text input, avatar selection, and video preview, with consistent spacing.
- Subtle animations when the AI avatar talks in the preview to make it more realistic
